# Interactive Display Lab
The Interactive Display Lab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is an interdisciplinary research group shaping the future of touch-based computing. We fuse psychophysics, engineering, and HCI to develop advanced haptic displays that elevate digital interaction—putting touch front and center for immersive, engaging, and useful tactile experiences.
