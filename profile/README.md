# Interactive Display Lab
The Interactive Display Lab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is an interdisciplinary research group shaping the future of touch-based computing. We fuse psychophysics, engineering, and HCI to develop advanced haptic displays that elevate digital interaction—putting touch front and center for immersive, engaging, and useful tactile experiences. 

## Facilities
Our lab is housed on the third floor of the state-of-the art $95M and 230,000 square foot Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at 306 N Wright St, Urbana, IL, room 3038. We are equipped with electronics assembly and debugging equipment, prototyping lab and optical bench, student offices, a photo and VR studio room, as well as a lounge and demonstration area. Departmental mechanical, electrical, and clean room fabrication facilities are located below on floors one and two.

## Repository Structure
To support both open demonstration efforts and internal collaboration, this organization maintains two types of repositories:

### 🔓 Public Repositories
These contain open-access demo files, reference implementations, and research artifacts that the lab publishes for the broader community.
They but may not necessarily be licensed for unrestricted reuse. Please check the license file of each repository.

### 🔐 Private Repositories
These are shared among lab members for projects that involve overlapping infrastructure, prototype firmware, shared toolchains, and reusable skeleton code.
They serve as collaborative spaces for in-progress research, shared experimental pipelines, and internal documentation.
